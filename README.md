# ML Engineering Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning Engineering learning journey! This repository documents my path to understanding and implementing ML systems in production environments.

## What I'm Learning

I'm building skills in several key areas of ML Engineering:

1. Cloud Computing
   - Working with AWS, GCP, and Azure free tiers
   - Understanding cloud infrastructure for ML
   - Learning to deploy ML models in the cloud

2. Containerization with Docker
   - Creating reproducible environments
   - Packaging ML applications
   - Managing dependencies effectively

3. Workflow Management
   - Using Apache Airflow for ML pipelines
   - Automating ML workflows
   - Managing data processing tasks

4. ML Development
   - Building projects with Hugging Face
   - Implementing ML models
   - Understanding ML deployment

5. Data Engineering Foundations
   - Creating data pipelines
   - Processing and storing data efficiently
   - Managing data for ML projects

## Project Structure

This repository is organized to support professional ML development:

- `data/`: Stores our datasets
  - `raw/`: Original, untouched data
  - `processed/`: Cleaned and prepared data
- `models/`: Holds our trained ML models
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `src/`: Main source code directory
  - `data/`: Code for data processing
  - `models/`: Model-related code
  - `utils/`: Helper functions
- `tests/`: Code testing and validation

## Progress Tracking

I'll update this section as I complete different parts of my learning journey, documenting key milestones and lessons learned.
